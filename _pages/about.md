Research Focus
======
I am generally interested in reasoning, which I believe is a key aspect of human intelligence that sets us apart from other species. My current focus is on building LLM agents that can reasoning. The emergence of large language models has bridged the gap between these two domains in several ways:

1. With just a few prompts, we can easily construct an interactive environment tailored for reasoning tasks.
2. Large language models are capable of offering feedback (rewards) for various steps (states) in the reasoning process.
3. These models can also suggest feedbacks/reflections/self-improvements/policy updates for reasoning strategies, enhancing their abilities to solve complex problems.

I'm also working on open domain grounded reasoning that extends [NELLIE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07662).

Previously, I've worked on logical reasoning that uses Lean to reduce hallucination in the reasoning process (under ARR review, will update the link once out of the review stage).



About Me
======
With six years of industry and research experience in speech processing and self-supervised models, my focus is now shifting to LLM. To that end, currently I'm studying at JHU as a master student and working with Professor [Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/) and [Benjamin Van Drume](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/).

Reflecting on my career, I've noticed a pattern where unfortunate external events have occurred during my time at various companies, significantly influencing my professional path.
While I was getting accustomed to my role at DiDi, the company encountered [serious regulatory issues](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2022/05/24/didi-to-delist-from-nyse-after-overwhelming-yes-vote-by-shareholders/?sh=4d105596cba0) with Chinese authorities, resulting in its removal from the NASDAQ.
During my time at YuanFuDao, the [Double Reduction Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Reduction_Policy) was introduced, which imposed restrictions directly affecting YuanFuDao's core business operations.
As I was adapting to my position at Shopee, the company's stock price dropped 80% due to the global economic crisis and tensions between China and the US, leading to [extensive layoffs](https://techwireasia.com/2022/09/why-is-e-commerce-giant-shopee-on-a-layoff-spree/).
