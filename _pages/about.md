Research Focus
======
I'm interested in the **self-improvement** capability of LLMs. If we begin with the “end” (superintelligence/AGI) in mind, relying on human annotation won't get us there. We need to teach the model to interact with the environment and self-improve. Specifically, I'm interested in:
- **Understanding the underlying reason** that prevents LLM from effective self-improvement
- **Building an environment** that provides faithful feedback for self-improvement
- **Incorporating reasoning techniques** to solve issues during self-improvement

I am also broadly interested in **reasoning**, which (IMHO) is a key aspect of human intelligence that sets us apart from other species. In the realm of reasoning, I've worked on:
- **Logical reasoning** that uses theorem prover Lean to reduce hallucination in the reasoning process
- **Multi-step reasoning** that

About Me
======
With six years of industry and research experience in speech processing and self-supervised models, my focus is shifting to LLM. To that end, I'm currently studying at JHU as a master's student under the supervision of Professor [Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/) and [Benjamin Van Drume](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/).

Reflecting on my career, I've observed a pattern where significant external events have impacted my role. 
While I was getting comfortable with my role at DiDi, the company encountered [serious regulatory issues](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2022/05/24/didi-to-delist-from-nyse-after-overwhelming-yes-vote-by-shareholders/?sh=4d105596cba0) with the Chinese government, resulting in its delisting from New York Stock Exchange.
During my time at YuanFuDao, the [Double Reduction Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Reduction_Policy) was introduced, which imposed strict restrictions on YuanFuDao's core business operations.
As I was adapting to my position at Shopee, the company's stock price dropped 80% due to the global economic crisis and the tensions between China and the US, leading to its [extensive layoffs](https://techwireasia.com/2022/09/why-is-e-commerce-giant-shopee-on-a-layoff-spree/).
