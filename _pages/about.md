Research Focus
======
I have a keen interest in reasoning, which I believe is a key aspect of human intelligence that sets us apart from other species. My current focus is on integrating planning with reasoning. The emergence of large language models has bridged the gap between these two domains in several ways:

1  With just a few prompts, we can easily construct an interactive environment tailored for reasoning tasks.

2  Large language models are capable of offering feedback (rewards) for various steps (states) in the reasoning process.

3  These models can also suggest improvements (policy updates) for reasoning strategies, enhancing the outcomes.


I'm also working on open domain grounded reasoning that extends [NELLIE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07662).


Previously, I've worked on logical reasoning that uses Lean to reduce hallucination in the reasoning process.


Personal Story
======
With six years of industry and research experience in speech processing and self-supervised models, my focus is now shifting to LLM. To that end, currently I'm studying at JHU as a master student and working with Professor [Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/) and [Benjamin Van Drume](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/).

I've come to realize that my career path has a unique flair for timing. At DiDi, as I was settling into my responsibilities, the company faced industrial tensions with the Chinese regulators, leading to its delisting from NASDAQ. My tenure at YuanFuDao was influenced by the 'Double Reduction Policy' that aimed to address China's dropping birth rate. And, as I was gearing up at Shopee, the global economic crisis took center stage, throwing another curveball into my professional path.
